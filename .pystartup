# Add auto-completion and a stored history file of commands to your Python
# interactive interpreter. Requires Python 2.0+, readline. Autocomplete is
# bound to the Esc key by default (you can change it - see readline docs).
#
# Store the file in ~/.pystartup, and set an environment variable to point
# to it:  "export PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pystartup" in bash.

#
#
# Greetings future self!  Are you getting an error while trying to load
# your python history file?  Blitz it, run python, exit with exit() function
# instead of ctrl^d...  ctrl^d has been the bain of this evening 20170614.
